    <p>NTS is currently unavailable in this territory</p>
    <p>NTS is an independent, global music platform broadcasting 24/7, dedicated to amplifying artists, communities, and culture from around the world.</p>
    <p>NTS is currently unavailable in this territory. We have joined the international cultural boycott in solidarity with the call from Palestinian civil society: <a href="http://nomusicforgenocide.org/">nomusicforgenocide.org</a>. As part of this boycott, access to NTS is geo-blocked in Israel.</p>
